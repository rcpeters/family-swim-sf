# family-swim-sf
generate map of when family swim is scheduled at public pools

## set up
This is hosted on replit at https://replit.com/@Ruth-GraceGrace/family-swim-sf

It uses Python 3.12

but if you need to run it elsewhere,
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

make a `constants.py` file to point to the specific map you want to update.
```
map_id = my_fake_map_id_1234
project_id = my_fake_project_id_1234
```

Replace `map_id` and `project_id` values with those from your map. Click the Settings gear to see them. I've redacted mine but here is where you can find yours.
